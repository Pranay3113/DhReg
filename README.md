# DhReg
R Code and Advantages of dhReg package:- There is no direct function to build Dynamic Harmonic Regression in R. We use Fourier function nested inside the xreg argument of ARIMA function. We need to find the value of K in the Fourier function such that AIC value is minimum. For that we need to use “nested for loop” to try different value of K in each Fourier function when we are dealing with multiple seasonality and choose that K where AIC value would be minimum. But working with “for loop” for high frequency time series data is time consuming, so we will use the concept of “Parallel Processing in sapply” instead of “for loop” in the “dhr” function of “dhReg” package which reduces the process time. While using the “dhr” function from “dhReg” package there is no need to write a complex “nested for loop”.
